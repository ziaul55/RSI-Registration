% Input
%   imgObj       - Subject image

% The VLFeat open source library implements popular computer vision algorithms 
% specializing in image understanding and local features extraction and matching. 
% Algorithms include Fisher Vector, VLAD, SIFT, MSER, k-means, hierarchical k-means, 
% agglomerative information bottleneck, SLIC superpixels, quick shift superpixels, 
% large scale SVM training, and many others. It is written in C for efficiency and compatibility, 
% with interfaces in MATLAB for ease of use, and detailed documentation throughout. 
% It supports Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The latest version of VLFeat is 0.9.21.
